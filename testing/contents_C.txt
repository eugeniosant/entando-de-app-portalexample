Contents embedded in a page via content widget

- Remove content "Sample - Announcement 4" (code "ANN60") published in a list of contents in page "Council".

PROCEDURE

1) execute Scripts

-- DATABASE *Port
DELETE FROM workcontentsearch WHERE contentid = 'ANN60';
DELETE FROM workcontentrelations WHERE contentid = 'ANN60';
DELETE FROM workcontentattributeroles WHERE contentid = 'ANN60';
DELETE FROM contentsearch WHERE contentid = 'ANN60';
DELETE FROM contentrelations WHERE contentid = 'ANN60' OR refcontent = 'ANN60';
DELETE FROM contentattributeroles WHERE contentid = 'ANN60';
DELETE FROM contents WHERE contentid = 'ANN60';

2) refresh configuration 

3) Verify "Council" page


FIRST TEST RESULT:

- Portal Works
- Page Council works and shows only existing contents
- the configuration of page "Municipal Council" works with an empty content section inside UI of configuration of widget "Contents - Publish Contents"
P.S. the configuration of that widget breaks in some cases (when there are more than two contents)
