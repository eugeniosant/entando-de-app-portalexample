Contents referenced by contents via link attribute or link on RTF

- Remove content "Sample - Announcement 1" (id "ANN57") linked inside content "Municipal Council" in page "Municipal Council".

PROCEDURE

1) execute Scripts

-- DATABASE *Port
DELETE FROM workcontentsearch WHERE contentid = 'ANN57';
DELETE FROM workcontentrelations WHERE contentid = 'ANN57';
DELETE FROM workcontentattributeroles WHERE contentid = 'ANN57';
DELETE FROM contentsearch WHERE contentid = 'ANN57';

DELETE FROM contentattributeroles WHERE contentid = 'ANN57';
DELETE FROM contents WHERE contentid = 'ANN57';

2) refresh configuration 

3) Verify "Municipal Council" page


FIRST TEST RESULT:

- Portal Works
- Municipal Council works
- Link inside text still present but the destination is the page itself
- Link inside attribute still present but the destination is the deleted content inside the on-the-fly page; 
the renderization of the destination of that link is the correct "on-the-fly" page but with empty main section

- the content editing of content "Municipal Council" works with right message inside link attribute ("The referenced content is not valid")
